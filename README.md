2.predict.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Decision tree.

3.predict2.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Support Vector Machine.

4.predict3.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Gaussian Naive Bayes.

5.predict4.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

6.tweet.py - learn to perform sentiment analysis on tweets based on a specific key word and store the result in a csv file.
