machine learning projects on Python-
1.	Applied Research project - applying MuZero on a simple game namely Connect4 and Tic Tac Toe
2.	Fifa player value project- Here i used fifa 19 dataset to predict what a new player will be valued at using the values of existing players and finding other correlations between the features
3.	Tetris.py- a game I made while studying for my Thesis proposal.
4.	Visualization project -A project to represent the various patches the trees grows in a particular area and which of them are flammable and how far are they away from a water source, apart from that another dataset was worked on, of employees where I represented various data points about the employees in a visual format.
5.	tweet.py - learn to perform sentiment analysis on tweets based on a specific key word and store the result in a csv file.
6.	FIFA Rader Chart- It is a model that gives the three most similar player to a specified player
7.	 Czech Bank Data Base- Analyzing all the Czech Republic banks in terms of profitability using Python, SQL, Neo4j and other technologies.
8.	ferris - basic python projects, made while learning to code in python. This includes a very basic quiz ferris.py, a basic guessing game guess.py, chef.py etc. among others.
9.	predict.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Decision tree.
10.	predict2.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Support Vector Machine.
11.	predict3.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Gaussian Naive Bayes.
12.	predict4.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
13.	Various data files for the code present in the file.
14.	Various practice codes I have made to while learning data analytics
