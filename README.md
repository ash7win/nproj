I have learnt the skills below while writing the corresponding scripts-

1.ferris - basic python projects, made while learning to code in python. This includes a very basic quiz ferris.py, a basic guessing game guess.py, chef.py etc. among others.

2.predict.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Decision tree.

3.predict2.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Support Vector Machine.

4.predict3.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Gaussian Naive Bayes.

5.predict4.py - made to understand the syntax and usage of Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

6.tweet.py - learn to perform sentiment analysis on tweets based on a specific key word and store the result in a csv file.

7. Project Files- These are project of my different subject in MSc in Data Analytics in Dublin Business School namely Machine Learning Project, Data Storage Project, Data Mining Project, Data Visualisation Project and proposal for Thesis in the last sem

8.Various data files for the code present in the file 

9 Various practice codes I have made to while learning data analytics
